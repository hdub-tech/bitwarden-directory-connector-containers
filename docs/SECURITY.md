# Security Policy

I take security extremely seriously, but I'm still thinking through how I want
to handle this (_[Issue #13]_). This is my first public project, and I'm not used
to being on this side of the curtain. In the meantime, if you find a security
problem, please [open an issue] and add the label "Type: security" to the
issue. If it is a huge terrifying security issue, I would ask that you
consider not putting the full details there until I have a chance to respond
and connect with you. I will never sweep a security issue under the rug; I am
just asking for the chance to make it right. Thank you!
